ALOFT TODO:

Segdups - merge redundant blocks
Name change NMD_predictor -> aloft._v1_0.py
Split ALOFT code into modules based on feature type
Remove the 'sort' dependency for vat input/output
Running VAT from within ALOFT script is not parsing indels correctly
Output files in <basename>.aloft.vcf format which would simplify things for users
y/n VAT option -> I cannot run this with batch script -> remove this feature
Progress and cleaner status updates to stdout
Update all data
Segdup data is blank
PTM output - fewer columns, display positions instead of gene ids
Clear dependencies
Passing in VCF or VAT files is tedious, have one query
