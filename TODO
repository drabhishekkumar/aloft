ALOFT TODO:

Updated: 12/3/2013

Options for Hosting:
	1) Source code on github, provide link to data directory hosted on our machine
		- A: Easy to track changes, users will like format/submit issues
		- D: Cannot store data (multiple GB), github data limitations
	2) Package everything into one compressed file on our machine
	http://vat.gersteinlab.org/
	http://funseq.gersteinlab.org/
	https://github.com/mlin/PhyloCSF
	http://galaxyproject.org/
	https://code.google.com/

For Source Code:
Feature names should not be space separated, but separated by underscores
	e.g. indel_position_in_CDS not "indel position in CDS"
Phosphorylation option should be changed to post_translational_modifications
VCF File Metaheader Data needs to be updated and changed to reflect the 
features that ALOFT adds.
Update installation methods (bundle VAT executables) then update documentation
Ensure gencode18 files work with VAT
GERP rate will be changed, input file source change to bed files
	gerp cache will likely not be necessary
Networkx module optional install, update documentation
