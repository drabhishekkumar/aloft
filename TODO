Options for Hosting:
	1) Source code on github, provide link to data directory hosted on our machine
		- A: Easy to track changes, users will like format/submit issues
		- D: Cannot store data (multiple GB), github data limitations

Decisions:
Decide whether example test files should be downloaded or in example directory

For Source Code:
Feature names should not be space separated, but separated by underscores
	e.g. indel_position_in_CDS not "indel position in CDS"
Phosphorylation option should be changed to post_translational_modifications
VCF File Metaheader Data needs to be updated and changed to reflect the 
features that ALOFT adds.
Update installation methods (bundle VAT executables) then update documentation
Ensure gencode18 files work with VAT
GERP rate will be changed, input file source change to bed files
	gerp cache will likely not be necessary
Networkx module optional install, update documentation
PTM files update and check
Test minimum vcf input column numbers, add dummy columns
Splice changes implemented, check

For Documentation:
INSTALL Provide options for installation, i.e. alternative location install (Mayur)
INSTALL Download instructions
README Verify recessive neighbors and dominant neighbors descriptions
README Verify what the Ancestral= tag does in ALOFT VCF output 
QUICK_START 1000genomes data download instructions
QUICK_START Need the stdout messages output by aloft during runtime
