You will first have to have Python 2.7 or 3.x installed to run aloft. To check your python version:
python --version

Run install.py to compile all dependencies that aloft requires:
cd aloft
python install.py

aloft.py is the main script.
This will prompt up the help screen:
python aloft.py

The input VCF file supplied by --vcf should have a header line starting with #CHROM like:
#CHROM POS ID ALT REF ...

Only CHROM and POS are necessary to have, but the number of columns in this header line must match with the number of lines in the VCF file.

Then run python aloft.py with either of --vcf or --vat set, as well as all the data that aloft needs
