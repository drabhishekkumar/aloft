You will first have to have Python 2.7.x or 3.x installed to run aloft. To check your python version:
python --version

Run install.py to compile all dependencies that aloft requires:
cd aloft
python install.py

aloft.py is the main script.
This will prompt up the help screen:
python aloft.py -h

The input VCF file supplied by --vcf should have a header line starting with #CHR like:
#CHR POS ID ALT REF ...

Only CHR and POS are necessary to have, but the number of columns in this header line must match with the number of lines in the VCF file. Aloft will also accept if the line starts with #CHROM

Then run python aloft.py with either of --vcf or --vat set, as well as all the data that aloft needs

Note that you must run aloft in the current working directory since it relies on a few relative paths
