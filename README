A. Preface
Installation instructions can be found in INSTALL.
Quick Start instructions can be found in QUICK START.


B. Description
ALoFT takes as input an VCF (variant call format) file, runs it through the 
variant annotation tool (VAT) tools snpMapper and indelMapper, and runs 
the sorted VAT output through aloft.py, which calculates other variant-
specific features that give functional, evolutionary, mismapping, and other
information. ALoFT only calculates these parameters for frameshift indels, 
loss-of-function (LoF) SNPs, and for SNPs located in splice sites. ALoFT 
is split into separate modules based on features.


C. System Requirements
Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x
Linux or Mac OSX 10.6 and up


D. Installation:
$ cd aloft
$ /path/to/python/ install.py

This will install VAT, our gerp score caching module, and the networkx module
required to run aloft.


E. Input Files (Required):
1) VCF file containing unannotated variants, passed in using the --vcf option.
Alternatively, an annotated VCF file output by a separate manual run of VAT 
should be passed in with the --vat option. See options section below.

2) Reference files (defaults already in place after installation). 
For complete list, see section below regarding options and default values.


F. Output Files:
An output directory may be specified with the --output option.
Otherwise the output files will be written in the ./aloft_output directory.

Four files (may|will) be created in this output directory:

1) A vcf file that VAT generates if --vcf is supplied called vat_output.vcf.
This intermediate file is then run through aloft.py to produce the following 
three files. The variants in this file are listed in order, starting with
the lowest position on chromosome 1.

2) Output VCF file named <input_file_name>.aloft.vcf
Contains a culled list of formatted information calculated by VAT and 
features calculated by ALoFT in Variant Call Format for both lof variants
and spice site variants.

3) Tab-delimited file named <input_file_name>.aloft.lof
Contains the subset of VAT output associated with LoF SNPs and frameshift 
indels. All information from the VAT file is included, plus ALL features 
calculated by aloft.py for LoF variants.
Variants in the input file that intersect coding exons are included.
For variants with multiple transcripts, the variant data is calculated and 
output on different lines for each transcript.

4) Tab-delimited file named <input_file_name>.aloft.splice
Contains the subset of VAT output associated with splice site SNPs.  
All information from the VAT file is included, plus ALL features 
calculated by aloft.py for splice site SNPs.  Variants with multiple 
transcripts are output on multiple rows, one for each combination of 
alternate allele and affected transcript.
Variants in the input file that intersect splice sites are included.


G. Usage
ALoFT can be invoked as follows:
 $ cd aloft
 $ python aloft.py --vcf=/path/to/file --output=path/to/dir [--option3=arg1]...

Example:
 $ python aloft.py --vcf=vcf_file.vcf	(unannotated vcf file)
OR 
 $ python aloft.py --vat=vat_file.vcf	(VAT annotated vcf file)
OR 
 $ python aloft.py --vcf=vcf_file.vcf --output=/path/to/directory   
   (VAT annotated vcf file and custom output destination)


H. ALoFT Features in VCF Output
ALoFT retains input file VCF metaheader and variant information and details.
