ALoFT - Automated Loss of Function Tool
Version 1.0
Released 2013	
Gerstein Lab - Yale University

###############################################################################

I. Description
ALoFT takes as input an VCF (variant call format) file, runs it through the 
variant annotation tool (VAT) tools snpMapper and indelMapper, and runs 
the sorted VAT output through aloft.py, which calculates many 
other variant-specific features that give functional, evolutionary, probable 
mismapping, and other information. ALOFT only calculates these 
parameters for frameshift indels, loss-of-function (LoF) SNPs, and for SNPs 
located in splice sites. ALOFT is split into separate modules based on features.

II. System Requirements
Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x
RedHat Linux
NOT compatible with Windows systems


III. Installation:

cd aloft
/path/to/python/interpreter install.py

This will install VAT, our gerp score caching module, and the networkx module required to run aloft.


IV. Input Files (Required):

1) VCF file containing unannotated variants, passed in using the --vcf option.
Alternatively, an annotated VCF file output by a separate manual run of VAT 
should be passed in with the --vat option. See options section below.

2) Reference files. For complete list, see section below regarding options and 
default values. Most reference files should be already in place.


V. Output Files (may be overridden, see Section V Options):

Pass an output directory via --output

Four files may be created into this output directory:

1) A vcf file that VAT generates if --vcf is supplied.
This intermediate file is then run through
aloft.py to produce the following three files.

2) Output VCF file. Includes all information output by VAT and all features in ALOFT.

3) Tab-delimited file (labeled lof) containing the subset of VAT output associated with LoF 
SNPs and frameshift indels. All information from the VAT file is included, 
plus ALL features calculated by aloft.py for LoF variants.  
Each variant is output on multiple rows, one for each combination of alternate 
allele and affected transcript.

4) Tab-delimited file (labeled splice) containing the subset of VAT output associated with splice 
site SNPs.  All information from the VAT file is included, plus ALL features 
calculated by aloft.py for splice site SNPs.  Each variant is 
output on multiple rows, one for each combination of alternate allele and 
affected transcript.


VII. Usage
ALoFT can be invoked as follows:
cd aloft
python aloft.py [--option1=arg1] [--option2=arg2]...

Example:
python aloft.py --vcf=vcf_file.vcf
OR 
python aloft.py --vat=vat_file.vcf         (for specifying VAT input instead of unannotated vcf file)
OR 
python aloft.py --vcf=vcf_file.vcf --output=/path/to/directory    (for specifying output destination)


VIII. ALoFT Features
ALOFT calculated the following features for all variants:
Partial/full - Full if all transcripts of the affected gene are affected, 
partial otherwise
Transcript length - Length of affected transcript in nucleotides
Longest transcript - YES if transcript is the longest transcript affected by 
variant, NO otherwise
Shortest path to recessive gene - Minimum length of a shortest path to a 
recessive gene in protein interaction network

For premature stop-causing SNPs/indels only:

For splice SNPs only:


IX. Options
aloft.py recognizes the following options for altering input and reference files (default values given):
ALOFT will come packaged with most of the necessary reference files.

--vcf=""
Specifies path to VCF input file.  Set to empty string by default.  If none 
specified, NMD_predictor will try to skip VAT and run directly on the file 
given to the --vat option. This or --vat option is needed for proper execution.

--vat=/path/to/vat_output.vcf
Specifies path to VAT output file to run aloft on.

--output=/path/to/output_directory
Specifies path to tabbed output files and VCF file from ALOFT.

--annotation_interval=data/gencode.v16.pc.interval
Specifies path to genome annotation interval file. The interval file is
extracted for a Gencode file using the gencode2interval utility included in
VAT. The interval format is specified in VAT documentation: 
http://info.gersteinlab.org/VAT#Interval.

--annotation_sequence=data/gencode.v16.pc.fa
Specifies path to annotation sequence file in FASTA format. The fasta file
is extracted from the interval file by the VAT utility interval2sequences.

--cache=cache/
Specifies path to directory containing cache of GERP score information and protein-protein interaction information.  
Directory will be created if it doesn't already exist.

--elements=data/elements/
Specifies path to directory containing GERP element information.  Files must 
be named hg19_chr*_elems.txt, where * is 1-22/X/Y.

--annotation=data/gencode.v16.annotation.gtf
Specifies path to GENCODE genome annotation file.

--rates=data/bases/
Specifies path to directory containing GERP score information.  Files must be 
named chr*.maf.rates, where * is 1-22/X/Y.

--ancestor=data/homo_sapiens_ancestor_GRCh37_e71/
Path to directory containing ancestral chromosome files.  Files must 
be named homo_sapiens_ancestor_*.fa, where * is 1-22/X/Y.

--segdup=data/hg19-segdup.txt
Path to file containing genome segmental duplication regions.

--thousandG=data/ALL.wgs.phase1_release_v3.20101123.snps_indels_sv.sites.gencode16.SNPS.vat.vcf
Path to file containing 1000Genomes variant data.

--exomes=data/ESP6500/
Path to directory containing ESP6500 SNP data.  Files must be named ESP6500.chr*.snps.vcf, where * is 1-22/X/Y.

--ensembl_table=data/ens67_gtpcgtpolymorphic.txt
Path to file containing mappings between Ensembl gene and protein IDs.

--protein_features=data/prot_features/
Path to directory containing protein domain information.  Files must be named chr*.prot-features-ens70.txt, where * is 1-22/X/Y.

--transmembrane=tm_ens70/
Path

--nmd_threshold=50
Distance from premature stop to last exon-exon junction; used to find NMD cause. By default, this is 50.


X. Detailed 
The main components of ALOFT are aloft.py and vat_run.py.

aloft.py: Contains the main body of code.  If a VCF file is not 
passed in, Reads information from all relevant input files into memory, and 

vat_run.py: Contains run_vat(), a function called by aloft.py to run 
VAT automatically.
